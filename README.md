# AI Route Finder in London Tube Network

## Overview
This project involves implementing various search algorithms to find optimal routes in the London Tube network. The task includes agenda-based search and adversarial search, focusing on Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and heuristic search methods.

## Key Features
- **Search Algorithms**: Implementation of DFS, BFS, and UCS.
- **Heuristic Search**: Applying heuristic methods for efficient pathfinding.
- **Adversarial Search**: Adversarial search techniques in the London Tube network context.
- **Data Representation and Preprocessing**: Using 'tubedata.csv' for the Tube network representation.

## Technologies
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Python standard libraries.

## Dataset
Uses 'tubedata.csv', representing the London Tube network.

## Implementation Details
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Coding various search algorithms.
- **Performance Analysis**: Efficiency and effectiveness comparison.
- **Optimization**: Enhancing algorithm performance.

## Usage
Contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for algorithm implementation and comparison.

## Contributions
Welcome in areas of algorithm optimization or new heuristic search methods.
